# **Cagliostro Colab UI**
All-in-One, Customizable and Flexible AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion Web UI for Google Colab. Inspired by Linaqruf project<br>
 
## What's New?
### v.2.5.3 (21/04/23)
- `AUTOMATIC1111's stable-diffusion-webui` has been removed because Google Colab has prohibited the usage of any string named `stable-diffusion-webui` due to its massive usage of webui.
- `Anapnoe UI` has been set as default forcibly, also added warning messages.
- An `experimental` section has been added to install the `Anapnoe UI` integrated with `gradio 3.23.0`.
- `sd-webui-tunnels` forked by `camenduru` has been removed since the new ToS of Colab prohibits SSH shell or any similar tools.
- Now, there are two versions of the notebook available: 
   - [Cagliostro Colab UI](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Linaqruf/sd-notebook-collection/blob/main/cagliostro-colab-ui.ipynb): A compact and lightweight version that removes `AUTOMATIC1111's stable-diffusion-webui`.
   - [Cagliostro Colab UI Pro](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Linaqruf/sd-notebook-collection/blob/main/cagliostro-colab-ui-pro.ipynb): It has all the features of the Cagliostro Colab UI update in 19/04. However, since I do not have a Colab Pro subscription, I am unlikely to maintain it.

| Feature | Description | How to Use | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Multiple Downloads** | Download multiple files at once. | Fill in the URL fields with the links to the files you want to download. Separate multiple URLs with a comma. | `url1, url2, url3` |
| **Auto-prune** | Prune models after downloading | Add `fp16:` or `fp32:` before URLs. | `fp16:url1` |
| **Copy from Google Drive** | Copy models from Google Drive and load them in the session. | Make sure you have already mounted Google Drive. Type the path to your model/lora/embedding from Google Drive. | `/content/drive/MyDrive/path/to/folder` |
| **Fusing Folder** | Fuse models/embeddings/LoRA folder to `/content/fused/{category}`. | Make sure you have already mounted Google Drive. Add `fuse:` before the path to the folder. | `fuse:/path/to/gdrive/folder` |
| **Auto-extract** | Extract files after downloading. | Add `links/to/file` ending with `.zip` or `.tar.lz4`. Extract files to specified destination directory. | `https//link.com/to/file` |
| **Install Extensions** | Install extensions for Stable Diffusion Web UI. | Add the link to the GitHub repository to `custom_extension_url`. | `https://github.com/user/repo` |
